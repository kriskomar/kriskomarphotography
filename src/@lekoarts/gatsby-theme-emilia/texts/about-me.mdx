Originally from San Diego, CA, now married with 2 twin boys and settled in Kuna, ID, I finally got the courage
to start my own photography company. I've had a passion for striking images and film my entire life, but I
spent a great deal of time using the analytical and logical side of the brain as a software developer for
Scentsy, Inc. and a few other companies. I get very excited about photography because aside from being an art
form, it is intensely scientific and there is a lot of information to be learned. In photography one must be
naturally artistic to be able to identify and frame a great image, yet also understand the science behind
the equipment that is taking the photo. Only then can a truly beautiful image be captured.
